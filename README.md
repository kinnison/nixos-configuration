# NixOS Configuration for Daniel's systems

This repository hosts NixOS configuration, both host and user, for
me. This covers my personal laptops, desktops, etc. and also provides
a basis for any work machines I might want to use.

In addition, the home-manager modules are here to permit the configuration
of systems where I am not root.

for my personal machines as well as a custom installer ISO and some test
VMs.
